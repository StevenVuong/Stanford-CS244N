# Notes:
-  Classes can have @classmethods (unlikely will ever need) & instance methods
-  List is not hashable; dict and set is hash table, but set only stores keys. Tuples have fixed size & are hashable
    -  Dict is not hashable; dynamic size with no duplicates allowed. Hash table implementation which is quick to search
-  Can have named tuples `from collections import namedtuple` for readability
-  Can use `collections counter` to help as a counting tool
-  Numpy: [2,2,-1]: -1 for auto-fill
    -  e.squeeze(): remove unnecessary dimensions
    -  expand_dims(a, 0): [1,8]; (inserts dimenson at 0)
    -  Numpy concatenate to concat arrays
    -  Numpy.transpose(a, (2,1,0)): swaps 0th and 2nd axis
    -  np.dot(c,d) = c@d; (matrix mult)
        -  batch@weight + bias
